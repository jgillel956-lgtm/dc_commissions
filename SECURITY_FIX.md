# Security Fix - Removed Exposed Credentials

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE RESOLVED

**Date:** August 23, 2025  
**Issue:** Zoho API credentials were accidentally committed to the repository  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

## What Happened

Several files containing actual Zoho API credentials were committed to the repository:

- `get-tokens.js` - Contained actual client secret
- `test-table-data.js` - Contained actual client secret  
- `test-zoho-connection.js` - Contained actual client secret
- `tasks/CSV_MOCK_DATA_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Contained actual client ID, secret, and refresh token

## Actions Taken

1. **‚úÖ Removed all files with exposed credentials**
2. **‚úÖ Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future credential commits**
3. **‚úÖ Created template files without actual credentials**
4. **‚úÖ Added comprehensive security patterns to `.gitignore`**

## Files Removed

- `get-tokens.js` ‚Üí `get-tokens-template.js` (template version)
- `test-table-data.js` ‚Üí Removed (use template instead)
- `test-zoho-connection.js` ‚Üí `test-zoho-connection-template.js` (template version)
- `tasks/CSV_MOCK_DATA_IMPLEMENTATION.md` ‚Üí Removed

## New Template Files

- `get-tokens-template.js` - Template for getting Zoho tokens
- `test-zoho-connection-template.js` - Template for testing Zoho connection

## How to Use Templates

1. Copy the template files and rename them (remove `-template`)
2. Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`, etc. with actual values
3. **NEVER commit the files with actual credentials**

## Environment Variables

Store your credentials in a `.env` file (which is now gitignored):

```env
REACT_APP_ZOHO_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
REACT_APP_ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret
REACT_APP_ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_actual_refresh_token
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit credentials to version control**
2. **Use environment variables for sensitive data**
3. **Use template files for examples**
4. **Regularly audit your repository for exposed secrets**
5. **Rotate credentials if they were exposed**

## Next Steps

1. **Rotate your Zoho API credentials** if they were exposed
2. **Review your Zoho Analytics logs** for any unauthorized access
3. **Update your local `.env` file** with new credentials
4. **Test the application** with the new credentials

## Git History Cleanup

If you need to completely remove the credentials from git history, you may need to use `git filter-branch` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner`. However, since the repository is public, consider the credentials compromised and rotate them immediately.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** If you shared this repository publicly, consider the exposed credentials compromised and rotate them immediately in your Zoho Analytics account.
