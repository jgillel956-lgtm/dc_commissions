# Product Requirements Document: Revenue Analytics Dashboard

## Introduction/Overview

The Revenue Analytics Dashboard is a comprehensive business intelligence system designed to provide complete visibility into Disbursecloud's revenue streams, commission calculations, and profitability analysis. The primary goal is to enable accurate commission tracking and calculation for employees and referral partners by providing real-time access to complex revenue data that includes multiple fee structures, vendor costs, and commission hierarchies.

**Problem Statement**: Currently, commission calculations are complex and difficult to verify due to multiple revenue streams (payee fees, payor fees, interest revenue), various cost structures (vendor costs, company upcharges), and dynamic commission rates that vary by employee, company, and payment method. This makes it challenging to accurately determine what each person's commission should be.

**Solution**: A multi-tab dashboard system that provides complete financial transparency from gross revenue through to final net profit, with detailed commission tracking and filtering capabilities.

## Goals

1. **Commission Accuracy**: Enable precise calculation and verification of employee and referral partner commissions
2. **Revenue Transparency**: Provide complete visibility into all revenue streams and cost structures
3. **Business Intelligence**: Support data-driven decision making through comprehensive analytics
4. **Operational Efficiency**: Streamline commission verification and financial reporting processes
5. **Scalability**: Support growth in transaction volume and complexity
