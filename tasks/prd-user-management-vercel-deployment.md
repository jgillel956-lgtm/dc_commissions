# Product Requirements Document: User Management & Vercel Deployment

## Introduction/Overview

This feature will add user authentication and audit logging capabilities to the existing Zoho Analytics Management Interface. The application will be deployed to Vercel with a simple user management system that allows administrators to control access while maintaining a comprehensive audit trail of all user actions. The core functionality of performing CRUD operations on Zoho Analytics tables will remain unchanged, but will now be protected behind user authentication.

**Problem Statement:** Currently, the application has no user authentication or audit logging, making it impossible to track who made changes to the Zoho Analytics data or control access to the system.

**Goal:** Implement a secure, auditable user management system deployed on Vercel that maintains the existing CRUD functionality while adding user authentication and comprehensive audit logging.

## Goals

1. **User Authentication**: Implement secure login/logout functionality with basic user roles (admin/user)
2. **Access Control**: Restrict application access to authenticated users only
3. **Audit Logging**: Track all user actions including login/logout and data modifications
4. **Vercel Deployment**: Deploy the application to Vercel with database support for users and audit logs
5. **Data Integrity**: Maintain existing Zoho Analytics CRUD functionality while adding security layer
6. **Admin Management**: Provide admin interface for user management and audit log viewing

## User Stories

### Authentication & Access
- **As an admin**, I want to log into the application so that I can manage users and view audit logs
- **As a regular user**, I want to log into the application so that I can perform CRUD operations on Zoho Analytics data
- **As any user**, I want to log out securely so that my session is properly terminated
- **As an admin**, I want to see who is currently using the system so that I can monitor activity

### User Management
- **As an admin**, I want to view a list of all users so that I can manage access
- **As an admin**, I want to create new user accounts so that I can grant access to team members
- **As an admin**, I want to edit user roles (admin/user) so that I can control permissions
- **As an admin**, I want to deactivate user accounts so that I can revoke access when needed

### Audit Logging
- **As an admin**, I want to view audit logs so that I can track all user activities
- **As an admin**, I want to filter audit logs by user, action type, and date range so that I can investigate specific activities
- **As an admin**, I want to export audit logs so that I can maintain compliance records
- **As an admin**, I want to see detailed information about each action including what data was changed so that I can understand the impact

### Data Operations (Existing functionality with audit)
- **As an authenticated user**, I want to view Zoho Analytics tables so that I can see the current data
- **As an authenticated user**, I want to create new records so that I can add data to Zoho Analytics tables
- **As an authenticated user**, I want to edit existing records so that I can update data in Zoho Analytics tables
- **As an authenticated user**, I want to delete records so that I can remove data from Zoho Analytics tables
- **As an authenticated user**, I want to search and filter data so that I can find specific records

3.7. The system must allow exporting audit logs to CSV format

### 4. Database Requirements
4.1. The system must use Vercel Postgres for storing user accounts and audit logs
4.2. The system must create a "users" table with fields: id, username, password_hash, role, status, created_at, updated_at
4.3. The system must create an "audit_logs" table with fields: id, user_id, action_type, table_name, record_id, old_values, new_values, ip_address, user_agent, created_at
4.4. The system must maintain referential integrity between users and audit_logs tables
4.5. The system must implement proper indexing for efficient audit log queries

- Use JSON fields for storing old/new values in audit logs
- Implement proper indexing for audit log queries

### API Architecture
- Create Vercel Functions for authentication endpoints
- Create Vercel Functions for user management endpoints

2. **Audit Coverage**: 100% of user actions are logged with complete details
3. **Performance**: Application load time remains under 3 seconds
4. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime on Vercel deployment

## Open Questions

1. **Password Policy**: What are the minimum requirements for user passwords?
2. **Session Duration**: How long should user sessions remain active?
3. **Audit Log Retention**: Should there be any automatic cleanup of old audit logs?
4. **User Limits**: Is there a maximum number of users that should be supported?
5. **Backup Strategy**: How should the database be backed up on Vercel?
6. **Monitoring**: What monitoring and alerting should be implemented for the production deployment?
